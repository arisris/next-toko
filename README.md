### Simple Usage

Create mysql database in your local computer

copy .env.example > .env

edit .env and change DATABASE_URL

In this case i use "pnpm" for now i'm not sure that with other package manager can work. so
install "pnpm" first

```bash
$_ npm -g i pnpm
```

Follow instruction

```bash
$_ git clone https://github.com/arisris/next-toko.git
$_ cd next-toko
$_ pnpm install
$_ pnpm exec prisma migrate dev
$_ pnpm exec prisma migrate reset
$_ pnpm dev
```

After this you already have some seed data in DATABASE
